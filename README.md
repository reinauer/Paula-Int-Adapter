# Paula Interrupt Adapter

This is an Interrupt Adapter for the Amiga 500/2000 version of Paula.

## About

This adapter is an el cheapo version of the Action Replay. In connection with
the HRTMon software you can enter a debugger / monitor at any time while your
software is running, and mess around with all of memory (infinite lives, yay!)

## But Why?

I probably started getting into soldering because I wanted to have one of
[highpuff's INT7 adapters](https://www.ikod.se/a1200-600-int7/) but I could
not buy one from him, simply because the cost of shipping across the Atlantic
Ocean would by far exceed the value of the adapter. So I ordered a few PCBs
from across the Pacific instead and started soldering PLCC-52 sockets and
diodes.

Now, a few months later, I also got an Amiga 500 in my collection, and there
didn't seem to be a solution like highpuff's adapter available for the most
popular of all Amigas. So, I decided to make one.
